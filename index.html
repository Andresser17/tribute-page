            Upon his arrival, Carl is confronted by LSPD Officers Frank Tenpenny
            (with whom he has some history), Edward "Eddie" Pulaski, and Jimmy
            Hernandez, three highly corrupt members of the city's community
            policing unit, C.R.A.S.H. Tenpenny and his associates warn Carl
            early on that they intend to frame him for the murder of police
            officer Ralph Pendlebury, whom C.R.A.S.H. had killed to prevent him
            from exposing their illegal activities. They also force Carl to do
            work for them in exchange for his and his family's safety.

            After reuniting with Sweet, Kendl, Big Smoke, and Ryder, Carl learns
            that the Families have lost almost all of their territories to their
            main rivals, the Ballas, during his absence, and agrees to stay in
            Los Santos and help solve the gang's problems. While doing so, he
            befriends Kendl's boyfriend and Varrios Los Aztecas leader Cesar
            Vialpando, despite Sweet's initial objections, and helps his friend
            Jeffrey "OG Loc" Cross jumpstart his career as a rapper despite his
            lack of talent.

            The Families' resurgence is short-lived, as Carl discovers that Big
            Smoke and Ryder have betrayed the gang by forming alliances with
            C.R.A.S.H. and the Ballas, and planned the attack that killed his
            mother, which was actually meant for Sweet, in an effort to
            eliminate the Families. While Carl uncovers this, Sweet is ambushed
            by a group of Ballas and wounded. Carl arrives to rescue him, but
            both brothers end up arrested by the police. While Sweet is
            sentenced to life in prison, Carl is released on bail by C.R.A.S.H.,
            who take him to the countryside near Los Santos so that he can
            continue working for them, and threaten to have Sweet killed if he
            attempts to return to Los Santos and intervine in their dealings
            with Big Smoke, Ryder, and the Ballas, who have effectively taken
            over the city and flooded it with drugs.
